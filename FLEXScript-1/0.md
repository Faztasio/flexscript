## Introduction
The FLEXScript specification was inspired by ECMAScript 6-9, JavaScript, JScript and many other technologies compiling in to one beautiful, concise programming language specification.

## 1. Definitions
### 1.1. Object
A type, class, function, property and value are all Objects.  A value wrapped in an Object wrapper would be the same as it's own class.
```javascript
new String("String") == new Object("String")  // true
new Array([1,2]) == new Object([1,2]) // true
new Boolean(true) == new Object(true) // true
```

### 1.2. Scope
The orientation of FLEXScript.

### 1.3. Variable
A user-defined or built-in value.

### 1.4. Expression
A way to evaluate if the said expression is true or false.
```javascript
1 == 1 // true
1 > 0 // true
1 < 0 // false
```

### 1.5. Built-In
A type, class, function, property or value that is hard coded into the programming language.

## 2. Conformance
A conforming implementation of FLEXScript may update, modify or append to any regular expression syntax described in the FLEXScript specification.

A conforming implementation of FLEXScript will comply with ISO/IEC 10646 standard, plus amendments; 1:2005, 2:2006, 3:2008, 4:2008 and additional ammendments and corrigenda, or successor.

A conforming implementation of FLEXScript may not modify, add or remove any described syntax in the FLEXScript specification unless noted under the said syntax's section.  If it is a "Future Reserved Word", you may implement it in any way you wish.

## 3. Overview
The FLEXScript specification's overview documents the methods, usages, versions, references and side notes.  Other documentation on FLEXScript can be seen in seperate clauses and subclauses.

### 3.1. Usage in the Web
Much like ECMAScript, FLEXScript is usable in a website, but only if the source is programmed in Javascript or PHP, or an equivalent web oriented programming language, well it's general users are desktop developers.
Here the `document` and `window` would be defined in JavaScript, but FLEXScript deprecates `window` while document inherits `window`'s properties under the `document.window` property.
If implemented for website development, deprecation of the `filesystem` built-in is recommended, while it can be useful for reading configurations or logging non-important data such as voting for documentation as this has.
