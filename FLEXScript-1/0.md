## Introduction
The FLEXScript specification was inspired by ECMAScript 6-9, JavaScript, JScript and many other technologies compiling in to one beautiful, concise programming language specification.

## Definitions
### Object
A type, class, function, property and value are all Objects.  A value wrapped in an Object wrapper would be the same as it's own class.
```javascript
new String("String") == new Object("String")  // true
new Array([1,2]) == new Object([1,2]) // true
new Boolean(true) == new Object(true) // true
```
