## Introduction
The FLEXScript specification was inspired by ECMAScript 6-9, JavaScript, JScript and many other technologies compiling in to one beautiful, concise programming language specification.

## Definitions
### Object
A type, class, function, property and value are all Objects.  A value wrapped in an Object wrapper would be the same as it's own class.
```javascript
new String("String") == new Object("String")  // true
new Array([1,2]) == new Object([1,2]) // true
new Boolean(true) == new Object(true) // true
```

### Scope
The orientation of FLEXScript.

### Variable
A user-defined or built-in value.

### Expression
A way to evaluate if the said expression is true or false.
```javascript
1 == 1 // true
1 > 0 // true
1 < 0 // false
```

### Built-In
A type, class, function, property or value that is hard coded into the programming language.

## Conformance
A conforming implementation of FLEXScript may update, modify or append to any regular expression syntax described in the FLEXScript specification.

A conforming implementation of FLEXScript will comply with ISO/IEC 10646 standard, plus amendments; 1:2005, 2:2006, 3:2008, 4:2008 plus additional ammendments and corrigenda, or successor.

A conforming implementation of FLEXScript may not modify, add or remove any described syntax in the FLEXScript specification unless noted under the said syntax's section.  If it is a "Future Reserved Word", you may implement it in any way you wish.

## Reserved Words
Any reserved words defined later, or now, must be implemented in the said programming language.  If not, it is not a conforming implementation of FLEXScript, and a reference in any file must be appended.
(In no specific order):
```javascript
break
case
class
function
import
export
true
false
try
catch
private
const
super
switch
this
var
void
let
null
extends
typeof
case
int
```
