## FLEXScript
The FLEXScript specification consists of two things: cleanliness and conciseness.

It brings all the best programming languages into one very flexible, syntactically pleasant programming language with fundamental tools.  Here is a basic example of a complete module.

```javascript
import aVariable from 'vars.fs';

console.log(aVariable);
```
```javascript
// vars.fs
export aVariable = "Hello!";
```
Keep up to date with the FLEXScripts; this is currently the latest version.
